NOTES

Comes with Original Hardshell Case.
The neck is made in 1972
Fender introduced the 5-way switch in 1977, so it''s possible the guitar was made in early 1977 when they were still using 3-way switches. (*)
Fender switched from white to black plastic (pickguard, pickups, knobs,..) around 1975, and during this transition guitars may be seen with a mix & match of white and black plastic parts. A 1977 Strat could have mixed parts, but any later should be all black.'),
